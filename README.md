I'm a technology enthusiast based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a degree in Economics from Universidade Federal Fluminense. I have a broad interest in creating things and solving problems with technology, whether it's building web applications, designing user interfaces, or learning new programming languages.

In 2022, I was introduced to [DIO](https://www.dio.me/), a platform that connects people and companies, opening up amazing opportunities for learning and growth. It was there that I began my journey into web development, writing my first lines of code and building my first webpages. Since then, I have been dedicated to learning and improving my skills. To achieve this, I have been studying at [Balta.io](https://balta.io/) and [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/), where I began to feel more confident about my .NET skills.

More recently, Iâ€™ve worked as a .NET developer on projects including a project management system (SGGP) used by Hospital Albert Einstein, developed with .NET, MySQL, and Angular. I was responsible for building the backend, which included features like Microsoft Bookings integration, PDF generation, dashboards, user and area management, and internal chat. I also contributed to the evolution of similar solutions with a multi-tenant architecture. Throughout these experiences, the team followed Scrum methodology and used Azure DevOps for collaboration.

In addition to my technical expertise, here are a few facts about me that might interest you:

- I spent a year in Finland as part of a college exchange program, which was a life-changing experience.
- I worked as a SAP analyst for two years and developed a keen interest in writing documentation.
- When my notebook broke, I took it as an opportunity to learn how to fix and upgrade an old desktop PC.
- I believe in the power of different accounts to look up different subjects, which I think is a good way to control the algorithm.
- I love using language-learning apps to improve my skills in foreign languages.
